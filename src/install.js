// First, gapi-script is an npm package that loads Google API scripts and initializes some functions.

// The second package is called react-google-login and allows us to integrate the Google login feature into our React app. Additionally, react-google-login allows us to obtain the access tokens we need to access all Google APIs both quickly and safely.

// npm install react-google-login gapi-script
// yarn add react-google-login
